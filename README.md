Polygenic risk score (PGS) and machine learning framework for primary open-angle glaucoma prediction in African ancestry cohorts.
## Reproducibility

All analyses were performed in Python 3.11 using scikit-learn (v1.3), TensorFlow (v2.13), and PLINK 2.0.

PGS weights were generated using PRS-CS with an African ancestry LD reference panel.

Due to IRB and dbGaP restrictions, raw genotype data are not included in this repository. Researchers with approved access to POAAGG (phs001312) may reproduce analyses using the provided notebooks.
